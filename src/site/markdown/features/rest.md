# REST APIs

Spring Boot provides
[excellent support for implementing REST APIs](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-developing-web-applications)
using both the [Spring Web MVC](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/web.html#mvc)
and [Spring Web Flux](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/web-reactive.html#webflux)
frameworks.

[Spring HATEOAS](http://projects.spring.io/spring-hateoas/) can be used to implement REST APIs that follow the concepts
of **Hypermedia As The Engine Of Application State (HATEOAS)**.

Last but not least, Girders 4 also supports [Swagger](./swagger.html) for defining and documenting REST APIs.
