# Features

This section describes the various features of Girders 4.

We have also listed a couple of features that you might look for, where Girders is just using the features of Spring
Boot straight through. Spring Boot actually provides support for many more features that are not mentioned here. So make
sure you also check out the
[Spring Boot documentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/) if you need something
that is not mentioned here.
