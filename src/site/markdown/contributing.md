# Contributing to Girders

Girders is the standard platform for the development of server-side Java applications at Netcetera. We have a
[small team](./team-list.html) that maintains and developers Girders, but we are happy about everybody else
contributing as well.

## Ask Questions

If you have any questions about Girders, please ask them. You can contact the Girders team by email at
[girders@netcetera.com](mailto:girders@netcetera.com) or you can ask your questions to the Netcetera community on
[Plaza Questions](https://plaza.netcetera.com/wiki/questions/topics/65339425/girders).

## Report Bugs / Request Features

The easiest way to report bugs to or request features from the Girders team is by JIRA:

  https://extranet.netcetera.biz/jira/browse/NCA266

## Code Contributions / Pull Requests

Even better than just reporting bugs and request features is to provide the actual bug fixes and features to the
[Girders Team](./team-list.html). The source code for Girders is on our Netcetera Bitbucket instance:

https://extranet.netcetera.biz/bitbucket/projects/NCA266GIRD/repos/girders-boot/browse
  
Feel free to check it out, play around with it and submit pull requests.

## Documentation Contributions

Last but not least, we are also happy to take suggestions on how to improve the documentation. This is a tough one for
the Girders team, since we are maybe already to familiar with Girders to provide the right documentation for people
that do not know it so well yet.

If you have any ideas for improving the documentation, feel free to submit a bug report or a pull request for the
documentation. The
[source code for the documentation](https://extranet.netcetera.biz/bitbucket/projects/NCA266GIRD/repos/girders-boot/browse/src/site)
can also be found on Bitbucket in the folder `src/site`.
