## Mission Statement
> Girders is an open source Java application stack, developed and maintained by [Netcetera](https://netcetera.com/). 
It consolidates dependencies, libraries and frameworks to be used in a project. Furthermore, it provides additional code,
configuration and samples that aim at speeding up the development and maintenance of applications based on Girders.

## Getting Started
If you are new to Girders 6 and not familiar with Spring Boot, we recommend that you first study the
[documentation and guides of Spring Boot](https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/). Girders 6 is based on Spring Boot
and relies heavily on its design and the concepts. Next we recommend you have a quick look at the
