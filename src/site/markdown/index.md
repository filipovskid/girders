# Netcetera Girders

> [**Wordnet**](http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=girders): &#160;&#160;&#160;S: (n) **girder** (a beam made
usually of steel; a main support in a structure)

## Mission Statement
> Girders is the default Java application stack for [Netcetera](https://netcetera.com/) projects. It consolidates the
dependencies, libraries and frameworks that we use in our projects. Furthermore, it provides additional code,
configuration and samples that aim at speeding up the development and maintenance of applications based on Girders.

## Getting Started
If you are new to Girders 6 and not familiar with Spring Boot, we recommend that you first study the
[documentation and guides of Spring Boot](https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/). Girders 6 is based on Spring Boot
and relies heavily on its design and the concepts. Next we recommend you have a quick look at the
[concepts of Girders 6](./concepts/index.html).

From here, you basically have two possibilities:
