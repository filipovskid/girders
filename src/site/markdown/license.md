Girders is proprietary and commercial software and the intellectual property belongs to Netcetera. But we use Girders
to make our lives and the lives of our customers easier, not for a vendor-lock-in. The exact terms of of use for Girders
have to be defined in the contracts with our customers. Corresponding boilerplate is available in our contract
templates.

Normally, this includes the following terms:

* On request, the customer gets the **binaries and POM files** for all the Girders modules used in its project.
* The customer normally **does not get the source code** of Girders.
* The customer does not have to pay anything extra for Girders.
* The customer can continue to use Girders in its project even after any development or maintenance contracts
  with Netcetera have been terminated.
* The customer does not have the right to use Girders for other projects.
* The customer does not have the right to Girders updates (including security fixes) after any development or
  maintenance contracts with Netcetera have been terminated.
